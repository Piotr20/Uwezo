          <article>
               <p>Have you ever thought about going to Africa as a tourist? No?
                    Why? I guess you just don't think you would feel safe. But actually do you know that you are less
                    likly to be a victim of a crime in Africa than in Spain? In Africa you can not only see some unique
                    things and also help someone. Does it sound great?<img src="/images/Article_2_images/taxi.jpg"
                         alt="Taxi driver"> When you go to Africa hire a guide he knows locals and some nice places to
                    see and in this way you are
                    allowing him to make his living with helping you. And there is possibility that he will save money
                    and hire his brother than also save and buy new car and some years later he will have a logistics
                    company
               </p>
               <p>If you would like to buy some food buy it from such girl <img
                         src="/images/Article_2_images/banana.jpg" alt="Banana seller">
                    Yes maybe she doesn't have access to running water and is going everyday to some sort of lake to
                    wash
                    this bananas but they are still more healthy than this ones you are buying in your shop.</p>
               <h3>And simply enjoy African culture.</h3><video autoplay muted loop
